    Function Constructors:
1. Func const are use for creating objects in js.
2. We can call the constructor directly.
3. constructor name should starts with Caps.
4. function Name(){
.............}
 var march = new Function()
   Function( arg1, ar2, ....){
     name : "";
     class : " ";
   }
5.when we call the constructor , it will create an object.
6.dont have any return stmt.
7. Any varibale which gets created by using any constructor fun. 
Then that variable will persists the properties that constructor function provides.
var march = new Function()
8. Adding property to constructor using prototype.


what is hoisting?
1.using the variable or fun before defining it.
2.calling the func before declaring.
3. let and const doesnot support hoisting.(TDZ)
4.var support hoisting, hoisting happen at the top of code.
5.it will get memory located.
6. whenever we call var , fun we need to initailaise them in before call.

What is the DOM?
1.Documentary Object Model.
2. it will manipulate the html elements in the webpage.
3.Accessing the elements from html and make changes with js.
4. it will help make the document dynamically.
5.it is programming interface or web browser.

HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior 
to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript 
can not understand the HTML document directly. So, a corresponding document is 
created(DOM)(Documentary Object Model) DOM is basically the representation of the 
same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects. 
Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>)
 in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM. Now, Javascript can access 
each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.

Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN.
undefined: variable is defined,but in memorey creation phase, it will take undefined.
  let marks =50;
not defined: varibale which is not present in either global or local scope.
NaN: Not a Number,
let marks ="50"

How many operators do we have in JS ?
Operators: 
1.It will use to compare the value , adding the value.
Airthmatic: +,-,*,/,% 
Comparison Operators : it always returns you the boolean values(true or false)  ==, ===, 
 < ,> , <= ,>= ,!=, !==

!= returns when values are not equal , just check the values only.
!== return when values are not equal and check the value , datatype.
 
a++  => a= a+1; variable gets printed first, then its value get incremented.
++a  => 1+a ; first value gets incremeented, then var get printed.
a--  => a = a-1;
--a  => 1-a;
Logical Operators: && , ||, !.
Mathematical Reasoning:

a++  => a= a+1; 
&&                 ||               ! 
A  B  A&&B    A   B   A||B      A   !A
T  T   T      T   T    T        T    F
T  F   F      T   F    T        F    T
F  T   F      F   T    T
F  F   F      F   F    F

Ternary Operators:
  <condition> ? <success o/p> : <failure o/p>
10 == 12 ?  "present"   : "false"

Bitwise OPerators:
LOgic Gates:::::: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR.
 
XOR            
1  1  0
1  0  1
0  1  1
0  0  0

5 => 0 1 0 1.

&, | ^ , ~, a<<b, a>>b, a>>>b
a<<b => 0 1 0 1 << 1  => 1 0 1 0 --shift last numbr to left
a>>b => 0 1 0 1 >> 1  => 0 0 1 0 --shift first numbr to right

call():  it is use for calling the fun , we need to give comma separated..,
in case of call, each and every arguments which is required to be passed to the function will be passes individually.

displayUserDetails.call(user, "TCS", "developer").
displayUserDetails(user);

Apply() : each and every arguments which is required to be passed to the function will be inside an array.
displayUserDetails.apply(user, ["TCS", "developer"]).

bind(): it will return you new function, and this new function , we can call at anytime and anywhere.
const newFun = displayUserDetails.bind(user);
newFun("Infosys", "Tester")

what are closures?
Closures: When a fun is running , there is a another variable , we may access the local variable .........
It is a combination of inner function and the lexical environment that was created by the inner function.
We are able to access the variable inside the function becoz of closures.

function outer(){
  let a =10;
  function inner() {
     console.log(a);
  }
  inner();
}
outer();

Prototypes:
The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects.
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
Prototype is a global property which is available with almost all the objects
it is like object but it contains methods and the methods can also accept by child object
prtotoype  inherit features from one another.
mechanism by which js object inherit features frm other
Prototype provides various functions for developing JavaScript applications.

function Person (name , age ){
  this.name = name ;
  this. age = age;
  this.Salary = 10000;
}
let person1 = new Person ( " Bhagya  " , 21 );
let person2 = new Person (" Siddhu " , 23);
console.log(person1);
console.log(person2 );
// in case when want to add other properties, in the object created using function constructor.....
person1.Salary = 2500000;
console.log(person1);

// in case when you want to add properties inside this function constructor.
Person.prototype.company = 'walmart';
person1.company = 'prepbytes';
console.log(person1.company);
What is prototype chain?
Person1 and person2 , these are the ojects using function constructor, so their master or parent be the Person.
Each Object, array , etc., always contains a prototype property from which we can access all the inbuilt functions.
Incase of person1 , its prototype level1 is Person function constructor. , then person2 ,its level2 object constructor function.
and this chain goes on like this until you dont get value of __proto__ as 'null',.This concept is prototype chaining.


what are pure functions?

when a same input is passed every time the function will return same output.

function calculate(sum){          2
   return (sum+ 0.5);         2.5
}
calculate(2);    //2.5
calcualte(5);    //5.5
A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns 
the same result if the same arguments are passed. 
It does not depend on any state or data change during a programâ€™s execution. 
Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.

 if u call the functon and input the same value and the output value is always the same that function is a pure function,it dossent get effected by anything except the input valueg
well if u pass same argument and every time u get different value that is not a pure function

What is the use of setTimeout?
setTimeout:  after certain time , it will return or print the result.
clock, netbanking, irctc..
setTimeout(callback, time-interval);
setTimeout(()=>{
   console.log("Hello");
},2000);
