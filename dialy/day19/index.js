//API-Application Programming Interface

//It connects 2 application to pass from one to another..

//AJAX- It helps us to query the API's .It allows us to make the server calls and display the data without reloading the pages.
//It allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way with help of AJAX calls,we can request data from web servers dynamically .it helps us to create CRUD application

// $("button").click(function(){
//     $.ajax({
        
//         url:"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1",
//         type : "GET",
//         success:function(response){
//          console.log(response); //{userId: 1, id: 1, title: 'delectus aut autem', completed: false}--out
//          document.getElementById("learn").innerHTML=response.title;//delectus aut autem--title of library will appear in html in-place of <p></p> ,when we click button "Hide" 
//          document.getElementById("learn").innerHTML=response.id;//1 will appear in <p>
//          document.getElementsByClassName("head").innerHTML=response.title
